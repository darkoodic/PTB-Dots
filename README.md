Psychtoolbox scripts used for generating, saving, and displaying approximate number dot displays.

You can use these scripts in three ways, with each being a separate script:

1. To generate and immediately display randomized dot displays following various parameters, like changes in size, ratio, etc. This is the most common way for testing adults and children. 

2. To generate and save individual trials as .png or .jpeg files for later use and consistency across subjects. 

3. To display pre-made images generated by the program. This is useful for paradigms that require precise control over the kinds of stimuli (e.g., confidence hysteresis paradigms).
